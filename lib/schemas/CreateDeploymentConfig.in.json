The deployment is successful if six or more instances are deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40 is specified, deploy to up to five instance at a time. The deployment is successful if four or more instance are deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the deployment fails.</p> <note> <p>In a call to the get deployment configuration operation, CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime returns a minimum healthy instance type of MOST_CONCURRENCY and a value of 1. This means a deployment to only one instance at a time. (You cannot set the type to MOST_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST_COUNT or FLEET_PERCENT.) In addition, with CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime, AWS CodeDeploy attempts to ensure that all instances but one are kept in a healthy state during the deployment. Although this allows one instance at a time to be taken offline for a new deployment, it also means that if the deployment to the last instance fails, the overall deployment is still successful.</p> </note> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/instances-health.html\">AWS CodeDeploy Instance Health</a> in the <i>AWS CodeDeploy User Guide</i>.</p>",
